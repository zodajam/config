Hello everyone! My name is zodajam, at least on the internet. My real name would be "Rasmus", and I'm from Sweden.
I have been developing websites for some while and I am currently learning more JavaScript to make my web pages more interactive.
If you want, you can head over to my website, <a href="https://neocoral.org">neocoral.org</a> and cehck out some of the projects I have made.
Or you can check through my <a href="https://github.com/zodajam?tab=repositories">GitHub Repos.</a>
